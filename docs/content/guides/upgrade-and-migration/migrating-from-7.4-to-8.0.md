# Migrating from 7.4 to 8.0

[[toc]]

## Overview

The purpose of the following guide is to facilitate a smoother update to the 8.0.0 version of Handsontable. We strongly recommend an upgrade to make use of all beneficial changes and fixes brought by the introduction of the completely new architecture for row and column management.

## Context

In prior versions of the Handsontable component, the calculation between physical and visual indexes was based on callbacks between hooks. With time, when the component got more feature, it slowly led to inconsistencies and the calculation was imperfect in some cases due to growing complexity. To fix that there was a major change in the whole system of mapping the indexes. This version introduces index mapper that stores, manages, and registers the indexes globally. Under the hood, it is indirectly responsible for managing both rows and columns, as a single source of truth to refer to. This modification is a major rewrite of the core feature and may result in breaking changes in your application.

## General guidelines

* Check if you use any of the features listed in the **Keywords** section, you need to address them first after the **installation**.
* Be sure to test the proposed solutions for keeping backward compatibility, if you experience any problems do not hesitate to reach out to us.
* You can also check the release notes for a complete list of all changes.

## Installation

Use the following command to update the **Handsontable** to 8th version:

```bash
npm install handsontable@8
```

### Using with wrappers

When you use the wrapper you need to update it as well. Run the following command, respectively:

If you use **Handsontable** with React:

```bash
npm install handsontable@8 @handsontable/react@4
```

If you use **Handsontable** with Vue:

```bash
npm install handsontable @handsontable/vue@5
```

If you use **Handsontable** with Angular:

```bash
npm install handsontable@8 @handsontable/angular@6
```

## Breaking changes of 8.0.0

## Removals of hooks

Hooks related to the visual and physical indexes were removed since new architecture for indexes management was introduced. To achieve the same functionality we suggest using the API. What is more, internal calls in the component's code to these hooks were removed and replaced with corresponding API methods. The following examples show how to preserve previous functionality.

### `modifyRow`, `unmodifyRow`, `modifyCol`, `unmodifyCol`

`modify*` and `unmodify*` hooks for rows and columns were removed. The actions to be taken are similar for both rows and columns.

For example, we will cover `modifyRow` hook. Prior 8.0.0 to move a row you had to use it

```js
modifyRow(row) {
  if (row === 0) {
    return 1;
  }

  if (row === 1) {
    return 0;
  }
}
```

In 8.0.0 it is no longer the case. To achieve the same functionality you need to use [`rowIndexMapper()`](@/api/core.md#rowindexmapper):

```js
hotInstance.rowIndexMapper.moveIndexes([1, 0], 0);
hotInstance.render()
```

Take look on the trimming example, too. It used to work like this:

```js
data: Handsontable.helper.createSpreadsheetData(10, 10),
modifyRow(row) {
  // Trimming first row.
  if (row < 9) {
    return row + 1;
  }

  return null;
}
```

Now, if you want to get the same results you need to use the [`TrimmingMap`](@/api/trimmingMap.md):

```js
import { TrimmingMap } from "handsontable/es/translations";
...

const customTrimmingMap = new TrimmingMap();

hotInstance.rowIndexMapper.registerMap('customTrimmingMap', customTrimmingMap);
customTrimmingMap.setValueAtIndex(0, true); // trimming index 0
hotInstance.render();
```

### `hiddenRow, hiddenColumn`

If you used [`HiddenRows`](@/api/hiddenRows.md) or [`HiddenColumns`](@/api/hiddenColumns.md) in your application you need do an update and use a corresponding index mapper:

Prior 8.0.0:

```js
hot.hasHook('hiddenColumn') && hot.runHooks('hiddenColumn', visualColumn);
```

Now:

```js
hot.columnIndexMapper.isHidden(hot.toPhysicalColumn(visualColumn));
```

An example for rows:

Prior 8.0.0:

```js
hot.hasHook('hiddenRow') && hot.runHooks('hiddenRow', visualRow);
```

Now

```js
hot.rowIndexMapper.isHidden(hot.toPhysicalRow(visualRow));
```

## Removing redundant `render()` from `after*` hooks

The sequence of `after...` hooks changed, for example: [`afterLoadData`](@/api/hooks.md#afterloaddata), [`afterFilter`](@/api/hooks.md#afterfilter), [`afterUnmergeCells`](@/api/hooks.md#afterunmergecells) are now called **before the render**. In the previous versions, you had to call [`render()`](@/api/core.md#render) to apply changes made with `after...` hooks. In some cases, depending on the number of hooks registered, it led to rendering all the cells multiple times. Many of these operations were redundant and unnecessary, resulting only in a performance bottleneck.

From now on, you can alter the `Handsontable` instance in each hook and it will re-render only once. To benefit from this change you have to review all your hooks and remove unnecessary render calls. Example:

```js
instance.addHook('afterFilter', function () {
  // ... your operations
  instance.render(); // <= remove this line!
});
```

## Plugins no longer enable other plugins

From version 8.0.0 you can set plugins separately. They no longer rely on each other tightly in terms of functionality, so it is up to the developer to use them simultaneously when needed. You can avoid unwanted "extra" functionality switched on by a supporting plugin.

[`NestedRows`](@/api/nestedRows.md) and [`Filters`](@/api/filters.md) no longer depend on nor enable [`TrimRows`](@/api/trimRows.md) plugin. To keep using the [`TrimRows`](@/api/trimRows.md) functionality, mostly use API or if your custom plugin is based on it, you need to enable the plugin explicitly:

Before 8.0.0

```js
nestedRows: true

filters: true
```

After:

```js
nestedRows: true,
trimRows: true

filters: true,
trimRows: true
```

[`ManualColumnFreeze`](@/api/manualColumnFreeze.md) does not rely on the [`ManualColumnMove`](@/api/manualColumnMove.md) plugin. To preserve the same functionality as before you need to set it explicitly:

Before 8.0.0

```js
manualColumnFreeze: true
```

After:

```js
manualColumnFreeze: true,
manualColumnMove: true
```

[`ColumnSorting`](@/api/columnSorting.md) will not enable `ObserveChanges`. To preserve the same functionality as before you need to set it explicitly:

Before 8.0.0

```js
columnSorting: true
```

After:

```js
columnSorting: true,
observeChanges: true
```

[`CollapsibleColumns`](@/api/collapsibleColumns.md) plugin no longer uses [`HiddenColumns`](@/api/hiddenColumns.md) plugin, hence it will not be enabled. What's more, it won't enforce the inclusion of the second plugin anymore. To preserve the functionality of hiding columns separately (out of collapsing) as before you need to set it explicitly:

Before 8.0.0

```js
collapsibleColumns: true
```

After:

```js
collapsibleColumns: true,
hiddenColumns: true
```

## Data reference and ObserveChanges plugin

Modifying the tableâ€™s data by reference and calling [`render()`](@/api/core.md#render) is no longer feasible. Now all the data-related operations need to be performed using the API methods such as [`populateFromArray()`](@/api/core.md#populatefromarray) or [`setDataAtCell()`](@/api/core.md#setdataatcell).

The source data API was changed as well and it will no longer return a reference to the source data object. Instead, it returns a copy of the data, possibly already modified by the [`modifySourceData`](@/api/hooks.md#modifysourcedata) and [`modifyRowData`](@/api/hooks.md#modifyrowdata) hooks. The change applies to all "getter" source methods - [`getSourceData()`](@/api/core.md#getsourcedata), [`getSourceDataAtCell()`](@/api/core.md#getsourcedataatcell), [`getSourceDataAtRow()`](@/api/core.md#getsourcedataatrow), [`getSourceDataAtCol()`](@/api/core.md#getsourcedataatcol) and [`getSourceDataArray()`](@/api/core.md#getsourcedataarray).

Since it breaks the link to original data source reference, [`setSourceDataAtCell()`](@/api/core.md#getsourcedataatcell) method and [`afterSetSourceDataAtCell`](@/api/hooks.md#aftersetsourcedataatcell) hook were introduced to maintain a similar functionality.

Before it was possible to set source data by reference to the data variable:

```js
data[0][0] = 'A1';
```

or by getting the reference to the underlying source data:

```js
hotInstance.getSourceData()[0][0] = 'A1';
```

Now API should be used:

```js
hotInstance.setSourceDataAtCell(0, 0, 'A1');
```

It is also worth to mention that [`getSourceData()`](@/api/core.md#getsourcedata) will return a clone of the entire dataset, when run without arguments - [`getSourceData()`](@/api/core.md#getsourcedata). However, if a row/column range is provided: `getSourceData(0, 0, 10, 10)`, it will filter the dataset with the [`columns`](@/api/options.md#columns) and/or [`dataSchema`](@/api/options.md#dataschema) options, and return only the columns configured to be visible.

Before it was also possible to extend the row-object by [`setDataAtRowProp()`](@/api/core.md#setdataatrowprop) method when working with **an array of objects as source data**. Since 8.0.0 the only way to do that is to use [`setSourceDataAtCell()`](@/api/core.md#setsourcedataatcell).

Check the following example:

```js
const hot = new Handsontable(container, {
  data: [
    { model: 'Roadster', company: 'Tesla' },
    { model: 'i3', company: 'BMW' },
  ],
});

hot.setDataAtRowProp(0, 'available', true) // This usage will throw an error in 8.0.0.
hot.setSourceDataAtCell(0, 'available', true) // This usage will set a new property in 8.0.0`
```

## Changes in ManualRowMove and ManualColumnMove plugins behavior

Both plugins has been adapted to work with Index Mappers.

Hooks, [`beforeRowMove`](@/api/hooks.md#beforerowmove), [`afterRowMove`](@/api/hooks.md#afterrowmove), [`beforeColumnMove`](@/api/hooks.md#beforecolumnmove), and [`afterColumnMove`](@/api/hooks.md#aftercolumnmove) have different set of parameters now.

Methods [`moveColumn`](@/api/manualColumnMove.md#movecolumn), [`moveColumns`](@/api/manualColumnMove.md#movecolumns), [`moveRow`](@/api/manualRowMove.md#moverow), and [`moveRows`](@/api/manualRowMove.md#moverows) have their arguments changed. From this version onward, the `target` argument was changed to `finalIndex` argument. They work differently now and a **new [`dragRow`](@/api/manualRowMove.md#dragrow), [`dragRows`](@/api/manualRowMove.md#dragrows), [`dragColumn`](@/api/manualColumnMove.md#dragcolumn) and [`dragColumns`](@/api/manualColumnMove.md#dragcolumns) methods overtook old methods place in terms of functionality**. To put it bluntly, if you want to preserve previous functionality of [`moveRows`](@/api/manualRowMove.md#moverows) rename it to the [`dragRows`](@/api/manualRowMove.md#dragrows).

**Important note!** If [`NestedRows`](@/api/nestedRows.md) is set to `enabled` the move is possible only by the drag in the UI or [`dragRow`](@/api/manualRowMove.md#dragrow)/[`dragRows`](@/api/manualRowMove.md#dragrows) methods of the [`ManualRowMove`](@/api/manualRowMove.md) plugin.

The "drag" methods comes with the `dropIndex` parameter. It directs where to **place** the dragged elements. The place you intend to drag the element is managed by **drop indexes**. You can imagine some sort of a drop zone between actual indexes of elements:

![drag_action](/docs/{{$page.currentVersion}}/img/drag_action.svg)

The "move" methods comes with the `finalIndex` parameter. It tells where to **overlap** the first element from the moved ones. The place you intend to move the element is managed by **visual indexes**.

![move_action](/docs/{{$page.currentVersion}}/img/move_action.svg)

Please note that in case of "move" methods some move actions are limited. For example, if you initiate a move of **more than one element** to the **last position** (visual index = the number of items - 1) the operation will be canceled. The first element in the collection you would like to move will try to reach the last position (`finalIndex`) which is feasible. However, the next ones will attempt to reach the position exceeding the number of all items.

You can find the plugin's isMovePossible API method useful when you want to determine if the move action is possible. `movePossible` parameter of [`beforeRowMove`](@/api/hooks.md#beforerowmove), [`afterRowMove`](@/api/hooks.md#afterrowmove), [`beforeColumnMove`](@/api/hooks.md#beforecolumnmove), and [`afterColumnMove`](@/api/hooks.md#aftercolumnmove) hooks may be helpful as well.

## Changes in ManualColumnFreeze plugin behavior

The [`ManualColumnFreeze`](@/api/manualColumnFreeze.md) plugin itself also works differently. Before the **v8.0.0** frozen columns attempted to go back to original positions upon the unfreeze. Currently, the original position is **not calculated**. It unfreezes the column just after the "line of freeze". The functionality changed because after several actions like **moving** the former position was rather estimated than determined.

## Using minSpareRows option with TrimRows plugin

Another breaking change is related to [`minSpareRows`](@/api/options.md#minsparerows) and [`minRows`](@/api/options.md#minrows). The difference is visible when the data is being trimmed (i.e. by the [`TrimRows`](@/api/trimRows.md) plugin) and the options are set. In previous versions the data which was supposed to be trimmed **included** [`minSpareRows`](@/api/options.md#minsparerows) and [`minRows`](@/api/options.md#minrows) which resulted in trimming them along with other rows. In version 8.0.0 **spare rows** are always present and cannot be removed by trimming.

Check the following code example:

```js
const hotInstance = new Handsontable(container, {
  data: Handsontable.helper.createSpreadsheetData(5, 5),
  minSpareRows: 2,
  trimRows: [1, 2, 3, 4]
});
```

The results before:

![before_8](/docs/{{$page.currentVersion}}/img/spare_before_8.svg)

The results after:

![after_8](/docs/{{$page.currentVersion}}/img/spare_after_8.svg)

To ensure your application works as expected you should review it and search the use cases of [`minSpareRows`](@/api/options.md#minsparerows) or [`minRows`](@/api/options.md#minrows), if the application relied on this mechanism you may need to adapt it. For example, in prior versions the following code:

```js
const hotInstance = new Handsontable(container, {
  data: Handsontable.helper.createSpreadsheetData(10, 10),
  trimRows: [0],
  minSpareRows: 2
}
```

rendered **0** spare rows. If you want to keep it that way you may need a workaround, for instance:

```js
const hotInstance = new Handsontable(container, {
  data: Handsontable.helper.createSpreadsheetData(10, 10),
  trimRows: [0],
  beforeCreateRow(index, amount, source) {
    const rowIndexMapper = this.rowIndexMapper;
    // If any row was skipped then block a creation of row execution.
    if (source === 'auto' && rowIndexMapper.getNotSkippedIndexesLength() < rowIndexMapper.getNumberOfIndexes()) {
      return false;
    }
  },
  minSpareRows: 2
});
```

## Custom editors

Custom editors will now use data attribute to recognize the input as an editor. Before this change, Handsontable depended on the CSS `className`. And it had to be `handsontableInput`. Now it is an attribute - `data-hot-input`. Focusable and editable elements must have this attribute set up to work properly. `ClassNames` were freed from restrictive names.

An example with `data-hot-input` in Custom editor, to make it work properly on a focusable element:

```js
createElements() {
  ...
  this.TEXTAREA.className = 'handsontableInput';
  ...
}
```

After the changes:

```js
createElements() {
  ...
  this.TEXTAREA.className = 'anythingYouWant';
  this.TEXTAREA.setAttribute('data-hot-input', true);
  ...
}
```

## Indexes that exceed the data length

Also, the methods [`toVisualRow()`](@/api/core.md#tovisualrow), [`toVisualColumn()`](@/api/core.md#tovisualcolumn) and [`toPhysicalRow()`](@/api/core.md#tophysicalrow), [`toPhysicalColumn()`](@/api/core.md#tophysicalcolumn) used to return index numbers that exceeded the overall length. For example:

```js
// Data set with just 10 rows.
const physicalRow = hotInstance.toPhysicalRow(20);
// physicalRow === 20
```

From now on, if you want to refer to them you will receive `null`:

```js
// Data set with just 10 rows.
const physicalRow = hotInstance.toPhysicalRow(20);
// physicalRow === null
```

It can be a breaking change for your project if any parts of it expected the output to be a `number`, now it will be `null`. In case you still want to use it as before you need to, for example, check for `null` and fallback to visual row index:

```js
const visualRow = 20;
const physicalRow = hotInstance.toPhysicalRow(visualRow) ?? visualRow;
// physicalRow === 20
```

## RecordTranslator in plugins

The `RecordTranslator` object was removed, as a consequence, `t` property is no longer available in the plugins. This alias could be used to translate between visual and physical indexes with four methods: `t.toVisualRow`, `t.toPhysicalRow`, `t.toVisualColumn`, `t.toPhysicalColumn`. It is advised to call the following methods directly on the instance: `hotInstance.toVisualRow`, `hotInstance.toPhysicalRow`, `hotInstance.toVisualColumn`, `hotInstance.toPhysicalColumn`. The mappers can be accessed using `hotInstance.rowIndexMapper` and `hotInstance.columnIndexMapper` properties.

This example shows how to migrate plugins from using `t` property to calling the method directly on the instance:

Before:

```js
const physicalColumn = this.t.toPhysicalColumn(column);
```

After the change:

```js
const physicalColumn = this.hot.toPhysicalColumn(column);
```

## Selecting data

**Left mouse button** click on the corner will select all cells with headers in 8.0.0.

It used to select just one cell:

![LMB_was](/docs/{{$page.currentVersion}}/img/LMB_was.gif)

Now the expected behavior is to select all cells:

![LMB_is](/docs/{{$page.currentVersion}}/img/LMB_is.gif)

To keep the previous behavior you need to use the following workaround:

```js
// manipulate the event that happens before the click on cells
beforeOnCellMouseDown(event, coords) {
  // apply only for coordinates that are top left corner outside the grid
  if (coords.col === -1 && coords.row === -1) {
    // stop other event listeners of the same event from being called
    event.stopImmediatePropagation();
    // use the index mapper method - getVisualFromRenderableIndex on both row and column to choose visual indexes
    // this will result in selecting the first cell in the corner
    const visualRow = this.rowIndexMapper.getVisualFromRenderableIndex(0);
    const visualColumn = this.columnIndexMapper.getVisualFromRenderableIndex(0);

    this.selectCell(visualRow, visualColumn);
  }
}
```

## Load data hooks arguments order

Hook [`afterLoadData`](@/api/hooks.md#afterloaddata) has been changed. Its first argument will present a **data source** that was set during the **load data** action. Now, a flag informing whether a load of data was done during initialization is the second argument. Also, a new corresponding hook, [`beforeLoadData`](@/api/hooks.md#beforeloaddata), has been introduced, it is called before loading data.

Before:

```ts
afterLoadData?: (initialLoad: boolean) => void;
```

Now:

```ts
afterLoadData?: (sourceData: object | void, initialLoad: boolean) => void;
```

[`beforeLoadData`](@/api/hooks.md#beforeloaddata) has the same order of arguments:

```ts
beforeLoadData?: (sourceData: object | void, initialLoad: boolean) => void;
```

## Column and row resizing hooks arguments order

`after*` and `before*` hooks related to resizing changed in terms of the order of arguments. Now the first argument is a `newSize` of a row or column and the second argument is `column` or `row`. "Current" prefix was dropped because this hook might not always be called on selection.

Here is the comparison:

Prior 8.0.0:

```ts
afterColumnResize?: (currentColumn: number, newSize: number, isDoubleClick: boolean) => void;
afterRowResize?: (currentRow: number, newSize: number, isDoubleClick: boolean) => void;
beforeColumnResize?: (currentColumn: number, newSize: number, isDoubleClick: boolean) => void | number;
beforeRowResize?: (currentRow: number, newSize: number, isDoubleClick: boolean) => number | void;
```

Now:

```ts
afterColumnResize?: (newSize: number, column: number, isDoubleClick: boolean) => void;
afterRowResize?: (newSize: number, row: number, isDoubleClick: boolean) => void;
beforeColumnResize?: (newSize: number, column: number, isDoubleClick: boolean) => void | number;
beforeRowResize?: (newSize: number, row: number, isDoubleClick: boolean) => number | void;
```

## Selection range have negative indexes

From `v8.0.0` selecting columns or rows with headers will include headers as a part of the selection range. We see headers as positioned relatively to the dataset. If the beggining of the dataset is at possition `(0, 0)` then headers will always have negative indexes. That makes them distingushable from the dataset and they can be easily filtered out if not needed.

When the selection is returned as an array, just map the values and limit them to positive values:

```js
hotInstance.getSelectedLast().map((indexIncludingHeader) => {
  return Math.max(0, indexIncludingHeader);
});
```

Selection Range object has a new method [`normalize`](@/api/cellCoords.md#normalize) that will do this for you:

```js
hotInstance.getSelectedRangeLast().from.clone().normalize()
```

## Removals

Hook `skipLengthCache` was removed because `indexMapper` is now responsible for the cache and length.

Public methods `colOffset` and `rowOffset` were removed and their functionality is now for internal use only.

Also, an **experimental** feature: `ganttChart` plugin was removed and is no longer supported.

If you use these features in your project and need backward compatibility, please contact the support (at [support@handsontable.com](mailto:support@handsontable.com)) for further information.
